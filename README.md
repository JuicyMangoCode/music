# 🎵 Music Assets for GMod `sound.PlayURL`

This repository serves as a dedicated **ogg hosting hub** for use with [`sound.PlayURL`](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.PlayURL) in **Garry's Mod**. All files are hosted via **GitHub Pages** for fast, direct, and reliable client-side streaming.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

A custom Python automation pipeline handles:

1. **Downloading** audio from YouTube via `yt_dlp`
2. **Converting** to `.ogg`
3. **Base64-encoding** filenames to ensure uniqueness and URL safety
4. **Uploading** to this GitHub repository under `music_assets/` via the GitHub API
5. **Generating shortened URLs** via TinyURL and saving them in `directories.json`

---

## 🖥️ Web Interface

A responsive and styled HTML frontend is included, allowing users to:

- 🔎 **Search** all uploaded `.ogg` files
- 🔗 **Open** audio files in a new tab
- 📋 **Copy** either the full direct URL or a **shortened TinyURL** for easy sharing or usage
- ✅ View-friendly on desktop and mobile

## 🎮 Usage in Garry's Mod

To stream audio in GMod using Lua, use the `sound.PlayURL` function:

### Full URL Example:
```lua
sound.PlayURL("https://tinyurl.com/example123", "", function(station)
    if (IsValid(station)) then
        station:Play()
    end
end)
```
⚠️ Use shortened URLs only if they resolve to direct ogg files. GMod requires the URL to point directly to a playable audio resource.
