# üéµ JuicyMango GMod Music Assets

A modern and automated repository for hosting `.ogg` music files used with [`sound.PlayURL`](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.PlayURL) in **Garry's Mod**. All files are streamed directly from **GitHub Pages**, ensuring fast, reliable playback in-game.

> Powered by a dynamic backend and streamlined developer tools.

## üåê Live Demo

**Website:**  
üîó [https://juicymangocode.github.io/music/](https://juicymangocode.github.io/music/)

**Backend Upload Server:**  
üîó [`https://90fa39d8-...replit.dev/`](https://90fa39d8-1c84-4210-a37d-b8ac10d057eb-00-1r97ja0zizqg4.pike.replit.dev/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The full pipeline is powered by a custom Node.js + Express backend:

1. üé• **Download Audio** from YouTube using `yt-dlp`
2. üîÑ **Convert** to `.ogg` using `ffmpeg`
3. üß† **Intelligently Rename** with sanitized and conflict-free filenames
4. üìâ **Compress if Necessary** to meet streaming size requirements
5. üöÄ **Upload to GitHub** via the GitHub API (`music_assets/` folder)
6. üîó **Shorten URLs** using the TinyURL API
7. üìÅ **Track Metadata** in `directories.json` for easy retrieval

All uploads are dynamically managed, with built-in locking to prevent API spam or concurrent conflicts.

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface Features

The frontend provides a clean, responsive UI:

- üîç **Searchable Audio List**
- üéß **Preview** any track directly in-browser
- üîó **Copy Full or Shortened URL**
- üì± **Mobile-Friendly Design**
- üß† **Backed by `directories.json` metadata index**

> The site is automatically updated when new tracks are uploaded.

## üéÆ Using Audio in GMod

### Basic Lua Example
```lua
sound.PlayURL("https://tinyurl.com/example123", "", function(station)
    if (IsValid(station)) then
        station:Play()
    end
end)
```

‚ù§Ô∏è Special Thanks
To the open-source community, contributors, and the GMod development scene for keeping Lua weird and wonderful.
